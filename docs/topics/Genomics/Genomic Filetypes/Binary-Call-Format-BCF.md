# Binary Call Format (BCF)


## ELI5:
A BCF file stands for Binary Call Format. It is a type of file that stores information in a special way so that
computers can understand it easily. Think of it like a secret code that only computers can read.

In this code, the information is stored in a series of 0s and 1s. These 0s and 1s represent different things, kind of
like how letters make up words. For example, the number 0 might mean "off" and the number 1 might mean "on."

When you open a BCF file on your computer, it knows how to read this secret code and turn it back into something you can
understand, like pictures or music or videos.

So basically, a BCF file is just a special type of file that holds information in a computer-readable way. It's like a
secret code that only computers know how to read!
