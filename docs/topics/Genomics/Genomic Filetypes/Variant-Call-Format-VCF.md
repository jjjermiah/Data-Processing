# Variant Call Format (VCF)

Another important file format in genomics is the Variant Call Format (VCF).

- This format is used to store genetic variations such
  as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variants.
- VCF files enable researchers to identify differences between individuals or populations and understand their
  implications in various diseases or traits.
